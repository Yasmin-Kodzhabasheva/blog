#use the node image again, but this time we tag it AS build. Doing so enables multi-stage builds in Docker, which means that we can use another base image later for our final image:

FROM node:20 AS build

#we also set the VITE_BACKEND_URL environment variable. In Docker, we can use the ARG instruction to define environment variables that are only relevant when the image is being built:
ARG VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/v1

#We set the working directory to /build for the build stage, and then repeat the same instructions that we defined for the backend to install all necessary dependencies and copy over the necessary files:

WORKDIR /build
COPY package.json .
COPY package-lock.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .

#Additionally, we execute npm run build to create a static build of our Vite app:
RUN npm run build

#Now, our build stage is completed. We use the FROM instruction again to create the final stage. This time, we base it off the nginx image, which runs an nginx web server:

FROM nginx AS final

#We set the working directory for this stage to /var/www/html, which is the folder that nginx serves static files from:

WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html

#Lastly, we copy everything from the /build/dist folder (which is where Vite puts the built static files) from the build stage into the final stage:

#A CMD instruction is not needed in this case, as the nginx image already contains one to run the web server properly.

COPY --from=build /build/dist .
